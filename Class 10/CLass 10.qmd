# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - te PDB. 

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R. 

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas which may cause problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray))
```
I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in the table

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats,2,commasum)
totals
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What fraction of Uniprot does the PDB cover in rough terms?

```{r}
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```

# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure 


We will learn the basics of Mol* (mol-star) homepage:
https://molstar.org/viewer/


We will play with PDB code 1HSG.

Show the ASP 25 amino acids:

## Back to R and working with PDB structures 

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an important protein: 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```


```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.


```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol*...
